Description: For this project our team will develop a Notepad application where users will be able to view and access notes across web and mobile applications. The application will be developed using frameworks that are common in tech today. We will develop a Representational state transfer (REST) Application Programming Interface (API), a constant integration and a persistence layer. The website will be deployed on Heroku. This repository will serve as the web code base for the project. The website will have sessions for persistance, it will feature oAuth2, along with thymeleaf, docker, a data persistance Layer, and will include unit tests for functionality.
